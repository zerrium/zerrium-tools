# Zerrium Tool Kit
> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of September 2025, I migrated from React CRA script to Vite. As the result, I managed to get PWA service worker functionality working again.<br><br>
> From now on, I wrap up this personal project. In the future, there might be less updates or maintenance to this repository unless I need a new feature for myself.<br>
> I think this is my first successful personal project that I actually use every day 😎
